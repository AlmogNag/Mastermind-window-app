# Bulls & Cows (Mastermind) — WinForms (C#)

A Windows Forms implementation of the classic code-breaking game (“Bulls & Cows” / “Mastermind”).  
Pick the number of guesses, choose colors for each slot, submit your guess, and get feedback until you crack the secret code or run out of attempts.

---

## Features
- Configurable number of attempts (chosen before the game starts).
- Color picker per slot with an 8-color palette.
- Per-row feedback after each guess (exact match vs. color-only match).
- Secret code row stays hidden until win/lose.
- Clear separation between UI and logic:
  - `GameLogic.cs` handles rules, target generation and feedback.
  - `GuessRow.cs` encapsulates a single guess row UI and state.

## Gameplay
1. On start, pick the number of allowed attempts.
2. For the active row, click each of the 4 slots to choose a color from the picker.
3. When all 4 slots are selected, click **Submit** to receive feedback:
   - Exact color in exact place → strong match.
   - Correct color in wrong place → partial match.
4. Continue row by row until you guess the full sequence or run out of attempts.
5. On win or loss, the secret code row is revealed.

## Implementation notes

### `GameLogic.cs`
- Randomly generates a 4-color secret from the allowed palette (typically without duplicates).
- `GetFeedback(...)` compares a guess to the secret and returns the counts used to fill the 2×2 feedback panel.
- `IsWin(...)` checks if all four positions match.

### `GuessRow.cs`
- Self-contained user control for a single attempt:
  - Four color buttons, a **Submit** button, and a compact 2×2 feedback area.
  - `Enable()` / `Disable()` to control interaction flow.
  - Guards submission until the row is complete.

### `GameForm.cs`
- Creates the hidden secret row (covered buttons), builds the list of `GuessRow` instances, opens the color picker for slot selection, calls `GameLogic` for feedback, advances to the next row, and reveals the secret on end.

### `GameConstants.cs`
- Centralized 8-color palette used across UI and logic.

### `ColorPickerForm.cs`
- Simple dialog with 8 fixed buttons mapped to the palette; returns the chosen color to the calling row.

## Future improvements
- Optional “duplicates allowed” mode and difficulty presets.
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility tweaks.
- Persist last settings (attempts).
- Sounds/animations and a simple stats screen.
